# Using OnsagerNet to learn lorenz system

This is an implementation of using OnsagerNet to learn Lorenz systems.

1. `data_generators.py`: define class deta_generator for generating input-output time series of a known ODE systems
2. `Lorenz_r16.npz`: (input, output) data of Lorenz system with $\sigma = 10, b = \frac{8}{3}, r = 16$ 
3. `Lorenz_r28.npz`: (input, output) data of Lorenz system with $\sigma = 10, b = \frac{8}{3}, r = 28$
